Currently, ``visigoth`` should be installed from a local source checkout using
``pip``. It depends on `psychopy <https://www.psychopy.org/>`_ and its
dependencies and on some libraries from the broader scientific Python ecosystem,
including numpy, scipy, and pandas.

The current version of ``visigoth`` is written for Python 2.7 and psychopy
1.85.0. More recent versions of psychopy support Python 3 and should be more
easy to install as a library. Updating visigoth to work with those versions,
including an easier (and documented) installation process, is on the agenda.

Getting eye tracking working will also require the SR Research ``pylink``
library which, last checked, had to be downloaded (in compiled bytecode) from
the SR research support forums.
